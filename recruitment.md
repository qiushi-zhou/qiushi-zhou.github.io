I am someone who have been very lucky to have received great mentorship from my PhD and Postdoc supervisors, and I am excited to pass it along to future generations of students who are driven by their curiosity to understand and make better interactive technologies. From October 2025, I have multiple open PhD positions along with Research Assistant and Postdoc opportunities for applicants at varying stages of study. I am also looking to advise MPhil research projects on topics related to the ones listed below.

<ul>
  <li>Any educational background that makes you confident for the position</li>
  <li>Strong technical skills, including but not limited to XR Prototyping in Unity C#, Motion Capture, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Arduino, and Digital Fabrication</li>
  <li>Basic understanding of the current research/industry landscape of HCI/XR</li>

## Artistic Exploration of HCI Conepts,


## AI-assisted mirror interaction
Mirror provides a specific context for interaction, as the goal is typically the same and the image one expected to see "oneself" is typically the same, enabling a much simper context space for recognition of user intention and action.
