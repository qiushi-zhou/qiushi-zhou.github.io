*Aarhus-Lancaster GEMINI team meetup on gaze-based XR interaction  (June 2025)*

I am someone who have been very lucky to have received great mentorship from my PhD and Postdoc supervisors, and I am excited to pass it along to future generations of students who are driven by their curiosity to understand and make better interactive technologies. I had the pleasure of co-supervising many PhD and Master projects with academics in Europe and in Australia. As a supervisor, I take an adaptive approach to cater for each student's diverse backgrounds and skillsets, while fostering an environment that maximises their empowerment and growth.

# Research Topics

## Input Techniques for Next-Gen XR Devices
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/in.png)

My latest postdoctoral research has been contributing to an <a href="https://medium.com/sigchi/announcing-the-2025-acm-sigchi-awards-17c1feaf865f">award-winning team</a> that pioneers foundational input methods and interaction guidelines for XR operating systems, including the latest Apple Vision Pro and Android XR. Our research output has been mostly on eye+hand interaction with a prototyping-based interaction design and engineering process. These works rely on our knowledge around the nature of gaze fixations and saccades, patterns of eye-hand coordination, and the metaphors of input that users are familiar with from using previous technologies, such as mouse and touchscreen. 

Learning from this experience, I am interested in designing the interaction techniques for future generations of XR devices. While we have seen the development in the capabilities of many novel input modalities inculding gaze, gestures, and even brain-computer interface, I believe that the "winning" technique that will be adopted in the future can only be discovered with the consideration of the past and current uses of interactive technologies. In this project, we will collaboratively brainstorm, design, and develop novel input techniques for future XR devices by incorporating empirical knowledge on human cognition and behaviour with past experiences in the design and engineering of input devices and techniques. I would love to work with student who enjoy reading the following papers and articles and are able to apply these thinking in their practice. Together, our research will yield immediate real-world impact and would inform the industry to benefit current and future users.

## AI-assisted Interaction with XR Mirrors
Mirror provides a specific context for interaction, as the goal is typically the same and the image one expected to see "oneself" is typically the same, enabling a much simper context space for recognition of user intention and action.

During my PhD, I have established my expertise in the international HCI community on using mirrors for novel XR interaction. I have pioneered this topic with a design space that covers the use of the two bodies/perspectives across the mirror, the egocentric and allocentric frames of reference for anchoring objects, and the use of the space behind the mirror as reflection or extension of the physical space [1]. 

I have further explored this space with novel XR interfaces, including a motor training interface that enables learners to effectively acquire physical movements demonstrated by a virtual instructor aligned with their mirror reflections [2], and a series of visualisations in mirrors to help dancers reinterpret their movements for dance improvisation [3].

## Theoretical and Historical Reflections on Interaction Design Concepts and Principles
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/history.png)
Aarhus University, my current institution, holds an important position in the international HCI community with its rich history in activity theory (AT) research that contributes to one of the cornerstone theoretical foundations of HCI research. In recent decades, this research effort has been led by Prof. Susanne Bødker [9] who had published influential papers that shaped contemporary HCI research. Since my appointment as a postdoc, I have been working with Prof. Bødker on analysing the use of XR through the lens of AT.
