From October 2025, I have multiple PhD positions open along with Research Assistant opportunities for applicants at varying levels of study. I am also looking to advise MPhil research projects. 

For all positions, I am looking for perspective applicants who have strong technical backgrounds, including but not limited to Unity C#, Arduino, Digital Fabrication, and Robot Programming. The ideal applicant should have a basic understanding of (or strong interest for) the current research and industry landscape of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Special consideration will be given to those who have interests in theoretical and conceptual thinking
