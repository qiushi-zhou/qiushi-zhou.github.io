*Aarhus-Lancaster GEMINI team meetup on gaze-based XR interaction  (June 2025)*

I am someone who have been very lucky to have received great mentorship from my PhD and Postdoc supervisors, and I am excited to pass it along to future generations of students who are driven by their curiosity to understand and make better interactive technologies. I had the pleasure of co-supervising many PhD and Master projects with academics in Europe and in Australia. As a supervisor, I take an adaptive approach to cater for each student's diverse backgrounds and skillsets, while fostering an environment that maximises their empowerment and growth.

# Research Topics

While the following topics show some of my immediate research interests, they can only work if they become tailored for the right candidate. We will discuss and determine together the detailed directions within a generic frame, according to your skills and experience. I would also love to work with people who are interested in and capable of working on something that touches on multiple topics.

## Interaction Techniques for Next-Gen XR Devices
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/in.png)

My latest postdoctoral research has contributed to <a href="https://medium.com/sigchi/announcing-the-2025-acm-sigchi-awards-17c1feaf865f">an award-winning team</a> that pioneers foundational input methods and interaction guidelines for XR operating systems, including the latest Apple Vision Pro and Android XR. Our research output has been mostly on eye+hand interaction with a prototyping-based interaction design and engineering process. These works rely on our knowledge around the nature of gaze fixations and saccades, patterns of eye-hand coordination, and the metaphors of input that users are familiar with from using previous technologies, such as mouse and touchscreen. 

Continuing this line of research, I will explore interaction techniques for future XR devices. While we have seen the development in the capabilities of many novel input modalities inculding gaze, gestures, and even brain-computer interface, I believe that the "winner" technique that will be adopted in the future can only be discovered with the consideration of the past and current uses of interactive technologies. In this project, we will collaboratively brainstorm, design, and develop novel input techniques for future XR devices by incorporating empirical knowledge on human cognition and behaviour with past experiences in the design and engineering of input devices and techniques. I would love to work with people who enjoy reading the following papers and articles and are eager to apply these thinking in their practice. Together, our research will yield immediate real-world impact and would inform the industry to benefit current and future users.

## Novel Interaction Combining XR and IoT Devices
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/out.png)

I believe that the future of XR lies in its capability of augmenting and modifying the experience with the physical reality instead of hiding it. However, because the development of XR has been mostly driven by VR, little consistent effort was made to re-design the physical reality to make it work with XR. At the same time, other previous works that are not typically as part of the XR field, such as UbiComp, Dynamicland, and Proxemic Interaction, have accumulated insights in how to embed interactive capabilities with computing in the domestic physical spaces. These insights set the stage for re-thinking the physical reality in the context of XR. 

In this project, we will explore novel interaction affordances by combining the capabilities of the XR interface and the opportunities of re-designing the physical reality in an IoT context. Specifically, we can explore how the position and relative movement of the XR-wearing body and its immediate peripersonal space among the extrapersonal space that is computationally defined by "smart" objects equipped with sensors and actuators, together in the domestic space that is full of apparent and hidden significations, rules, functions, and habits. Through physical and robot programming, we can demonstrate novel interaction affordances and concepts of XR x IoT that contribute interaction design principles and frameworks in this direction.

## AI-assisted Interaction with Mirrors
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/mirror.png)

Easily found in most domestic and public spaces, mirrors are strange objects that afford a specific type of interaction, as the goal is typically seeing oneself. This specificity in the context of its use simplifies the task of recognsing user intention and action, and allows us to design richer interaction capabilities with mirrors. While the main theme of my PhD research was designing novel interaction with mirrors in XR, I am now interested in exploring opportunities of enriching the interaction with mirrors with AI. 

In this project, we will explore ways of integrating the capability of AI, including LLM and generative models, into the interactive experience with mirrors that are beyond the typical conversational-agent or heads-up-display ideas. Starting from a more substantial understanding of the relationship between the user and their reflected image in the mirror, we will identify opportunities to augment/modify this experience through visual medium, with XR headsets and/or smart mirrors. Together, we will design and build flashy prototypes that can be used in research projects and art installations.

## Theoretical and Historical Reflections on Interaction Design Concepts and Principles
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/history.png)
Aarhus University, my current institution, holds an important position in the international HCI community with its rich history in activity theory (AT) research that contributes to one of the cornerstone theoretical foundations of HCI research. In recent decades, this research effort has been led by Prof. Susanne Bødker [9] who had published influential papers that shaped contemporary HCI research. Since my appointment as a postdoc, I have been working with Prof. Bødker on analysing the use of XR through the lens of AT.
