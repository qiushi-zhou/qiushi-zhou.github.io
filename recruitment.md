*Aarhus-Lancaster GEMINI team meetup on gaze-based XR interaction  (June 2025)*

I am someone who have been very lucky to have received great mentorship from my PhD and Postdoc supervisors, and I am excited to pass it along to future generations of students who are driven by their curiosity to understand and make better interactive technologies. I had the pleasure of co-supervising many PhD and Master projects with academics in Europe and in Australia. As a supervisor, I take an adaptive approach to cater for each student's diverse backgrounds and skillsets, while fostering an environment that maximises their empowerment and growth.

# Research Topics

## Input Techniques for Next-Gen XR Devices
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/in.png)
My current mentors, Assistant Professor Ken Pfeuffer and Professor Hans Gellersen, lead a world-leading research team on eye+hand interaction that had pioneered the Gaze+Pinch technique in 2017 [4] that was later adopted as the default technique for system navigation by Apple in their Vision Pro. The successful impact of their research was a result of prototyping-based innovation process led by Prof. Pfeuffer that has been passed down from his mentors who have made key contributions to the field, such as Ken Hinckley and Bill Buxton at Microsoft. I have been learning this approach by working closely with them through co-supervising PhD research projects on extensions and variations of the Gaze+Pinch technique. 

Our prototyping-based innovation process relies on extensive knowledge around the topic, such as the nature of gaze fixations and saccades, patterns of eye-hand coordination, and the metaphors of input techniques that users are familiar with from using previous technologies, such as mouse and touchscreen. These processes usually start from collaborative brainstorming around a whiteboard, where we sketch the crucial components of the novel interaction techniques, such as the dynamic adjustment of the selection cursor that adapts to the parallax effect in placing the finger between the eyes and the remote target, the different stages of a tapping gesture that indicate progressive intention behind an aim-and-press process, and the specific thresholds in the distances and angles of the finger movement during tapping recognition.

We have also collaborated with Dr. Mar Gonzalez-Franco (research lead at Google on XR interaction) and researchers from KASIT on using Gaze+Pinch to select multiple objects in XR. We analysed existing multi-select metaphors in desktop and in multitouch interaction techniques, and derived novel techniques through iterative brainstorming, testing, and parameter-defining. Our work contributes towards enabling future XR operating systems based on Gaze+Pinch interaction techniques (under revision at CHI) [8]. 

By mastering the prototyping-based innovation process under the mentorship of Prof. Pfeuffer while furthering my knowledge of scientific evaluation of eye-based interaction techniques with Prof. Gellersen, I have developed solid skills that will help me discover and define intuitive XR interaction techniques that can yield immediate real-world impact and would inform the industry to benefit current and future users.  


## Novel Interaction Combining XR and IoT Devices

digital fabrication for tangible interface (Melbourne School of Health Sciences),  I have also been conducting research on XR-mediated human-robot interaction with Wafa Johal and colleagues from the HCI group at University of Melbourne, with an OzCHI publication [11] and a paper submitted to IEEE RAL [12].


## AI-assisted Interaction with XR Mirrors
Mirror provides a specific context for interaction, as the goal is typically the same and the image one expected to see "oneself" is typically the same, enabling a much simper context space for recognition of user intention and action.

During my PhD, I have established my expertise in the international HCI community on using mirrors for novel XR interaction. I have pioneered this topic with a design space that covers the use of the two bodies/perspectives across the mirror, the egocentric and allocentric frames of reference for anchoring objects, and the use of the space behind the mirror as reflection or extension of the physical space [1]. 

I have further explored this space with novel XR interfaces, including a motor training interface that enables learners to effectively acquire physical movements demonstrated by a virtual instructor aligned with their mirror reflections [2], and a series of visualisations in mirrors to help dancers reinterpret their movements for dance improvisation [3].



## Theoretical and Historical Reflections on Interaction Design Concepts and Principles
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/history.png)
Aarhus University, my current institution, holds an important position in the international HCI community with its rich history in activity theory (AT) research that contributes to one of the cornerstone theoretical foundations of HCI research. In recent decades, this research effort has been led by Prof. Susanne Bødker [9] who had published influential papers that shaped contemporary HCI research. Since my appointment as a postdoc, I have been working with Prof. Bødker on analysing the use of XR through the lens of AT.
