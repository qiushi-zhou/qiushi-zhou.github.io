I am someone who have been very lucky to have received great mentorship from my PhD and Postdoc supervisors, and I am excited to pass it along to future generations of academics. From October 2025, I have multiple open PhD positions along with Research Assistant and Postdoc opportunities for applicants at varying stages of study. I am also looking to advise MPhil research projects on topics related to the ones listed below.

# Requirements 

For all positions, I am looking for self-motivated applicants with strong drive for excellence in HCI. Some combinations of the following traits are desired:
<ul>
  <li>Strong technical skills, including but not limited to Unity C#, XR Prototyping, Motion Capture, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Arduino, and Digital Fabrication</li>
  <li>Basic understanding of the current research/industry landscape of HCI/XR</li>
  <li>Good command of English for communication and academic writing</li>
  <li>Interest in theoretical and conceptual thinking regarding interaction design and the use and development of computing technology</li>
</ul>

# Research Topics

## Artistic exploration of HCI conepts, such as dance and embodied perception

## AI-assisted mirror interaction
Mirror provides a specific context for interaction, as the goal is typically the same and the image one expected to see "oneself" is typically the same, enabling a much simper context space for recognition of user intention and action.
