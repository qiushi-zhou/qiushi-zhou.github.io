## Interaction Techniques for Next-Gen XR Devices
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/in.png)

My latest postdoctoral research has contributed to <a href="https://medium.com/sigchi/announcing-the-2025-acm-sigchi-awards-17c1feaf865f">an award-winning team</a> that pioneers foundational input methods and interaction guidelines for XR operating systems, including the latest Apple Vision Pro and Android XR. Our research output has been mostly on eye+hand interaction with a prototyping-based interaction design and engineering process. These works rely on our knowledge around the nature of gaze fixations and saccades, patterns of eye-hand coordination, and the metaphors of input that users are familiar with from using previous technologies, such as mouse and touchscreen. 

Continuing this line of research, you will explore interaction techniques for future XR devices. While we have seen the development in the capabilities of many novel input modalities inculding gaze, gestures, and even brain-computer interface, I believe that the "winner" technique that will be adopted in the future can only be discovered with the consideration of the past and current uses of interactive technologies. In this project, we will collaboratively brainstorm, design, and develop novel input techniques for future XR devices by incorporating empirical knowledge on human cognition and behaviour with past experiences in the design and engineering of input devices and techniques. Ideally, you are someone who enjoys reading the following papers and articles and are eager to apply these thinking in practice. Together, our research will yield immediate real-world impact and inform industry to benefit current and future users.

## Novel Interaction Combining XR and IoT Devices
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/out.png)

I believe that the future of XR lies in its capability of augmenting and modifying the experience with the physical reality instead of hiding it. However, because the development of XR has been mostly driven by VR, little consistent effort was made to re-design the physical reality to make it work with XR. At the same time, other previous works that are not typically considered as part of the XR field, such as UbiComp, Dynamicland, and Proxemic Interaction, have accumulated insights in how to embed interactive capabilities with computing in the domestic physical spaces. These insights set the stage for re-thinking the physical reality in the context of XR. 

In this project, you will explore novel interaction affordances by combining the capabilities of the XR interface and the opportunities of re-designing the physical reality in an IoT context. For instance, you may explore novel uses of the position and movement of the XR-wearing body and its immediate peripersonal space among the extrapersonal space that is computationally defined by "smart" objects equipped with sensors and actuators, together in the domestic space that is full of apparent and hidden significations, rules, functions, and habits. Through physical and robot programming, we can demonstrate novel interaction affordances and concepts of XR x IoT that contribute interaction design principles and frameworks in this direction.

## AI-assisted Interaction with XR Mirrors
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/mirror.png)

Easily found in most domestic and public spaces, mirrors are strange objects that afford a specific type of interaction, as the goal is typically seeing oneself. This specificity in the context of its use simplifies the task of recognsing user intention and action, and allows us to design richer interaction capabilities with mirrors. After my PhD research on designing novel interaction with mirrors in XR, I am interested in exploring opportunities of enriching the interaction with mirrors using AI. 

In this project, we will explore ways of integrating the AI capabilities, including LLM and generative models, into the interactive experience with mirrors beyond the typical conversational-agent or heads-up-display approaches. Starting from a more substantial understanding of the relationship between the user and their reflected image, we will identify opportunities to augment/modify this experience through visual medium, with XR headsets and/or smart mirrors. Together, we will design and build cool prototypes that can be used in research and art projects.

## Theoretical and Historical Reflections on Interaction Design Concepts
![alt text](assets/images/recruitment/history.png)
I believe that HCI research can benefit from theoretical thinking, including cultural, media, cognitive, and social theories, as well as philosophy of technology. Embodied interaction (built on phenomenology) and instrumental interaction (built on cognitive theories of tool use) are great examples where new theoretical perspectives were brought into HCI and had profound impact on the field afterwards. Whereas we can find this type of work more regularly in the past, they have become scarce in recent years due to the waves of craze over new technical hypes every two months, which I think is precisely the reason why we need more theoretical thinking that grounds our understandings of HCI phenomena in the broader context of history.

An example from my ongoing work in this direction is combining theoretical lenses of activity theory and Simondon's philosophy of technology to provide a new perspective to understand the nature of XR interaction by revisiting its history with a focus on its dialectical development as a mediator of human use of computing carried out through artifacts of different kinds. Ideally, you are someone who would love to explore similar opportunities on related topics, and able to connect your interests in theoretical reading and thinking with HCI concepts and problems in profound ways. The forms of work that instantiate these thinking can vary, including HCI research papers, interactive prototypes, and art projects and installations.
