title: Recruiting for Postgraduate Positions @ Thrust of Computational Media and Arts, HKUST(GZ) 
permalink: /recruitment/
---
I am someone who have been very lucky to have received great mentorship from my PhD and Postdoc supervisors, and I am excited to pass it along to future generations of students who are driven by their curiosity to understand and make better interactive technologies. From October 2025, I have multiple open PhD positions along with Research Assistant and Postdoc opportunities for applicants at varying stages of study. I am also looking to advise MPhil research projects on topics related to the ones listed below. 

# Details

For detailed information on entry requirements, admission timeline, studenship, tuition fee, and else, please refer to official resources <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hkust-gz-information-hub_ai-cma-dsa-activity-7353801086882779137-kSIA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABVMZ8MBBiVO8-i72U2ARtt03Fr5Sr3w9s0">HERE</a>.

# Requirements 

For all positions, I am looking for self-motivated applicants with strong drive for excellence. Some combinations of the following traits are desired:
<ul>
  <li>Any educational background that makes you confident for the position</li>
  <li>Strong technical skills, including but not limited to XR Prototyping in Unity C#, Motion Capture, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Arduino, and Digital Fabrication</li>
  <li>Basic understanding of the current research/industry landscape of HCI/XR</li>
  <li>Good command of English for communication and academic writing</li>
  <li>Interest in theoretical and conceptual thinking regarding interaction design and the use and development of computing technology</li>
</ul>

# Research Topics

In addition to those, I welcome proposals from students interested in designing and studying novel interaction techniques in XR. You are encouraged to propose your own topic, provided it aligns with my broader interests in immersive technologies. My research focuses on interaction and communication in everyday AR/VR applications. I investigate how users perceive and engage with virtual content—such as through gaze, posture, smell, or taste—and how they express themselves via avatars. My work combines technical prototyping (e.g., Unity, Arduino) with empirical evaluation to enhance user performance, experience, and ergonomics. I take an empirical HCI approach, involving the development of interactive systems, the design and execution of user studies, and the analysis of user behaviour using both quantitative and qualitative methods.

## Artistic exploration of HCI conepts, such as dance and embodied perception

## AI-assisted mirror interaction
Mirror provides a specific context for interaction, as the goal is typically the same and the image one expected to see "oneself" is typically the same, enabling a much simper context space for recognition of user intention and action.
