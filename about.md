I started my PhD program at The University of Melbourne in 2019, advised by <a href="https://www.eduardovelloso.com/">Eduardo Velloso</a> and <a href="https://www.jorgegoncalves.com/">Jorge Goncalves</a>. My research interest is creating deeper connections between human embodied perception and computing devices.
