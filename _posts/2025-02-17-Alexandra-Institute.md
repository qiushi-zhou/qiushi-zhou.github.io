It was a pleasure for me to represent the XR research group at Aarhus University to host a visit by the team from Alexandra Institute. Our upstairs neighbors specilise in converting cutting-edge research outcomes to products that produce commercial value and benefit the public sector. It was super cool to show off our latest prototypes led by PhD and Master students, who received insights and advice from these experts.
