Our proposal for the 3rd Workshop on Gaze and Eye Movement in Interaction in XR (GEMINI) has been accepted at ISMAR 2025!

I'm organising this workshop with colleagues from Denmark and the UK. We look forward to submissions from XR researchers around the world and an exciting workshop in South Korea later this year!

Call for Participation:

After previous yearsâ€™ successes, we are happy to announce the 3rd Workshop on Gaze and Eye Movement in Interaction in XR (GEMINI) at ISMAR 2025. The workshop aims to reflect on the research agenda for gaze-based interaction in extended reality (XR). This is especially important due to the growing integration of eye-tracking technology in modern headsets, which presents significant research opportunities. 

Researchers, practitioners, and professionals in the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) are invited to contribute and discuss their original research, opinions, and work-in-progress that explore the intricacies of gaze in XR. GEMINI fosters an interactive format, featuring selected speakers who will delve into cutting-edge research, sparking engaging discussions. Contributions, adhering to TVCG format, should push the boundaries of understanding and innovation in XR interaction. 

Join us on this exciting journey as we collectively reshape the future of XR interaction, exploring the possibilities of a more immersive and seamlessly integrated XR experience.

Important Dates (All deadlines are 23:59 AoE)
 Submission deadline (via PCS): 18 July 2025
 Notification deadline: 01 August 2025
 Camera-ready deadline: 15 August 2025
 Workshop: 8 October 2025 (tentative depending on conference limitations)
