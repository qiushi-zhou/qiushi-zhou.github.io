I gave a guest lecture for the subject Usability Engineering at University of Sydney for Master students. My talk gave a brief account of the history of HMD-based mixed reality, and elaborated on my perspective of how the pubic conception of (future) mixed reality technologies has been shaped by the unique experience and curiosity of people living through different periods of time. The lecture attempted to demonstrate this shaping process by revealing its traces in pop culture paralleling the contemporary technological advances, with the aim of helping students recognise the driving forces behind the evolving interests in emerging technologies through a historical perspective.
