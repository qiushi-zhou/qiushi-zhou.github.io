Another semester, another Aarhus-Lancaster Meetup! This week, we had a fun gathering between Postdocs, PhDs, and Master students who work with Prof. Hans Gellersen in Aarhus to share research ideas and skills. I delivered a Masterclass on reviewing in HCI, and shared experience in career development in academia. We were lucky to have the presence of a few Professors from the HCI group in Aarhus at the Moesgaard Museum. It's always a pleasure to meet our remote colleagues in Lancaster!
