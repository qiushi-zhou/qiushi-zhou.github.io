The Nordic Pre-CHI Event last week was a blast! We had around a hundred participants from eight Universities in the Nordic countries gathering on the campus of University of Copenhagen. We saw presentations of 23 papers that were accepted (and many awarded!) at CHI by nearly all of its subcommittees. I was amazed by the quality of the research behind the presented papers and the diverse range of topics they cover. It was especially impressive to see the strengths of the Nordic HCI resarch community on theory, design, critical computing and more. 

It is always nice to see people connect and catch up with each other at events like this. We saw many happy smiles at the Q&A, around the puzzles and the LEGO corner, in the pub and during the lab visit at the Human-Centred Computing section at KU. We hope everyone who attended this event had a nice experience ahead of the conference in Japan, and we look forward to the event next year to be hosted by Robin Welsch at Aalto University in Finland! 

We would like to thank everyone who helped make this event possible, including all session chairs and presenters, Joanna Bergstr√∂m and Tobias Langlotz for technical support, Poul Lystrup Thomsen and Michael Smirnov for photography, and our generous sponsors Pioneer Centre for AI, DIREC - Digital Research Centre Denmark, and the Human-Centred Computing section at Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen - DIKU. 

It was my pleasure to have worked with my co-organisers at University of Copenhagen for this event: Teresa Hirzle, Tor-Salve Dalsgaard, and Jonathan Sutton.
