Today, I have finisehd my share of lecturing for the Augmented Reality course at Aarhus University. The subject aims to provide the fundamental theoretical knowledge and development skills for Master students in Computer Science. Co-teaching with Prof. Ken Pfeuffer this semester, I covered half of the planned content including the history of AR and the key interaction concepts and principles. I had fun to have also discussed my on perspectives on the history and visions of AR and to share my own research outcomes with the students.
