We just had a great launch event last night for the art project “Guài” that I have been working on in collaboration with the artists Mindy Meng Wang and Monica Lim from the VCA! The artwork combines my research on mixed reality mirror interaction with AI, and delivers a dazzling multimedia experience enabled by the artist team to discuss human-AI relationship. The work is part of Melbourne Fringe Festival and will be on exhibition at Footscray Community Arts Centre from 5 to 15 Oct: https://melbournefringe.com.au/event/guai/ 

Shortly after the lauch, we have received a 4-star review from The Age, a leading newspaper in Australia.
