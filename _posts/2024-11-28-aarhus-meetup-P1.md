It was a great pleasure hosting the annual XR Collaboratory meetup of Pioneer Centre for AI at Aarhus for the first time! 

On Thursday, we exchanged ideas for collaboration between the P1 affiliates, and further discussed our Moonshot ðŸš€ðŸŒ– for the collaboratory. We drafted shared missions toward an XR-mediated Human-AI interaction in the future with inspirations from an insightful talk given by Anders Bo Pedersen on how visions are linked with deliveables in the XR industry. 

It was really nice to connect with everyone again and I'm looking forward to continuing the collaborations and discussions together next year.
