I'm honoured to be granted the opportunity to work as a Subcommittee Chair Assistant for the User Experience and Usability subcommittee. It was a great learning experience for me to attend and help organise the PC meetings, and to be exposed to the rigorous discussions and debates over paper submissions. I'm open to any volunterring opportunitiy to help with events and conferences for the HCI research community.
