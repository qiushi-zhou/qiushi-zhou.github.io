I had the pleasure of co-organising on online seminar on Friday with Harald Haraldsson and Ken Pfeuffer between two active XR Collaboratories at Cornell Tech in New York and Pioneer Centre for AI across Denmark. We shared research ideas and teaching expereinces, and hopefully have built new connections across the two continents! 
I have learned a lot from the research talks, and especially from the discussions on different approaches to setting up technical infrastructure for project-based teaching of XR-related content, and on how to work with teaching and evaluation in the era of LLMs. 
Thanks to everyone who participated and presented! - (Special thanks to those in Denmark who kindly agreed to join in a Friday afternoon Tor-Salve Dalsgaard Arpit Bhatia Guido Makransky Serge Belongie üëè )
