Last year, our team received a grant from the <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/mec/melbourne-innovated">Melbourne InnovatEd</a> incubation program to develop a physiotherapy teaching and learning tool Spinallog v2. With the collaboration between a team of physiotherapy instructors, engineering specialists and HCI researchers, we battled through the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and succcessfully delivered a working prototype. Watch me talk about the journey below or on <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/mec/melbourne-innovated/innovated-showcase">THIS PAGE</a>.
