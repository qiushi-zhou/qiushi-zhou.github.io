Just finished a productive trip to Sydney --- I gave a research talk at the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science/basser-seminars.html">Basser Seminars</a> at The School of Computer Science, University of Sydney. The talk encapsulated the main theme of my PhD research around augmented reality interaction with mirror reflections. I also gave a guest lecture to the class of Human-Computer Interaction on the same topic. Finally, it was fun attending ISMAR 2023 at UNSW! I got to see some cool presentations and to meet new friends and catch up with old ones.
